Structured Logging with Serilog in ASP.NET Core 10

1 - Why Logging is important ?

	- Monitoring
	- Debugging
	- Auditing/Tracing

2 - Why Serilog ? 

- Support structured logging
- Sinks
- Enrichers
- High Performance cause async and batching 

3 - what are the differences between Normal Logging and Structured Logging ?


Getting Started with Serilog in ASP.NET Core 10

- Install-Package Serilog.AspNetCore
- Configuration (appsettings.json , Program.cs )


Level	Usage
Verbose	Verbose is the noisiest level, rarely (if ever) enabled for a production app.
Debug	Debug is used for internal system events that are not necessarily observable from the outside, but useful when determining how something happened.
Information	Information events describe things happening in the system that correspond to its responsibilities and functions.
Warning	When service is degraded, endangered, or maybe behaving outside its expected parameters, Warning-level events are used.
Error	When functionality is unavailable or expectations are broken, an Error event is used.
Fatal	The most critical level, Fatal events demand immediate attention.





Configuring Serilog + File Sink + Output Formatting

We have 2 ways to make configuration for Serilog in ASP.NET Core 10
  1 - Code-based configuration (Program.cs)
  2 - Configuration-based configuration (appsettings.json)


  Sink  



  Structured Logging
  timestamp
  level
  message
  exception
  properties 

  JSON formatter






  Why Seq?
  - Centralized log management
  - Powerful querying capabilities
  - Real-time monitoring
  - Integration with Serilog
  - Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.Seq
  - Configuration (appsettings.json , Program.cs )


  Run Seq using Docker?
  docker run --name seq -d -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y -p 8081:80 -p 5341:5341 datalust/seq
